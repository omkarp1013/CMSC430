# CMSC 430, Racket Basics

You may collaborate freely on this assignment if it's helpful to you.
The whole point is to learn the bits of a86 you will need for this
course, so simply copying someone else's code will not serve you well
in the long run.

# ABOUT

These are a series of finger-exercise programs to help you:
- learn a bit of a86
- practice with the mechanisms of assembly such as registers, memory,
  and the stack

# SUBMIT

Use `make submit.zip` from within the `a86-basics` directory in order
to create a zip file suitable for submission on Gradescope.
