# CMSC 430 Midterm 2


## Instructions

There are SIX parts to this midterm. Each part has its own directory with a
README and additional files. Read the README for the instructions on what to do.


## Communications

If you have questions about the exam, post a _private_ question on Piazza. We
will likely disable public posts during the exam time to make sure this doesn't
go wrong. Old (public) Piazza posts will still be visible.

Answers to common clarifying questions will be posted by course staff in an
updating FAQ on Piazza.

You may not communicate with anyone outside of the course staff about the
midterm. Doing the midterm with other people will result in a referral to the
OSC.


## Submission

You should submit your work as a single zip file containing this directory.
Upload this zip to Gradescope.

To create a submission zip file, do `make submit.zip` from within the `m2/`
directory (the same directory where this README is located). Then upload the
resulting `submit.zip` file to Gradescope.

Unlike other assignments, Gradescope will only give feedback on the basic
well-formedness of your submission. This means it will check that the layout is
correct and all necessary files are present, and it will ensure you have
uploaded syntactically valid Racket code. You will not receive any feedback
about the correctness of your solutions.

If you fail these well-formedness tests, we will not be able to grade your
submission. Passing these tests only means your submission is well-formed; your
actual grade will be computed after the deadline. **IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
UPLOAD A WELL-FORMED SUBMISSION.**


## Notes

  * We left `TODO` comments in the places where you ought to write code.

  * We tried very hard to give sufficiently detailed explanations of the
    requirements for each part of the midterm. Although we will answer
    clarifying questions when you need help understanding what is asked of you,
    please do your best to look for the answers to your questions in the README
    files first.

  * You should not need to create any new files at any point, and we would
    prefer that you do not.
