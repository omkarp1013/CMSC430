# CMSC 430, Racket Basics

You may collaborate freely on this assignment if it's helpful to you.
The whole point is to learn the bits of Racket you will need for this
course, so simply copying someone else's code will not serve you well
in the long run.

# ABOUT

These are a series of finger-exercise programs to help you:
- learn a bit of Racket
- practice with structural recursion and type-based program design

This style of programming will be used throughout the course, now is
the time to master the style!

If you've mastered the style, you can write these programs on
auto-pilot.  If you haven't, you will struggle.
