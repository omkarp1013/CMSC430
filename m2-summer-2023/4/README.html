<p>Languages take different approaches when a function is called with
the wrong number of arguments. Most statically typed languages like
OCaml and Java will use the type system to rule out such programs.
Racket treats such mismatches as run-time errors and halts the
computation when such an error occurs.</p>
<p>We saw how to implement this run-time error checking mechanism in
assignment 5. Without adding the arity checking of assignment 5, the
compilers for Iniquity, Jig, and Loot produce code that simply crashes
or produces wrong answers when arity mismatches occur.</p>
<p>Javascript takes a different approach. The design of Javascript is
largely driven by the philosophy to <strong><em>keep going</em></strong>
in the face of possible errors. Very few things in Javascript result in
what we would call a run-time error: something that stops further
computation. Arity mismatches are a good example. If a function is
called with the wrong number of arguments in Javascript, the program
simply keeps going. It doesn’t crash and it doesn’t signal an error. It
has a well-specified semantics for such cases.</p>
<p>Here’s what Javascript does:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if a function is called with too many arguments, the extra
arguments are evaluated but then ignored in the body of the
function.</p></li>
<li><p>if a function is called with too few arguments, the remaining
parameters are bound to a special <code>undefined</code> value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>function f(x) { return x; }
f();</code></pre>
<p>This calls <code>f</code> with 0 arguments, even though it expects 1,
hence <code>x</code> is bound to the <code>undefined</code> value and
therefore the call returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Despite the name, <code>undefined</code> is just a value in
Javascript. There’s really nothing special about it.</p>
<p>Here’s a slight modification:</p>
<pre><code>function f(x, y) { return x; }
f(1);</code></pre>
<p>This calls <code>f</code> with 1 argument, even though it expects 2.
Here <code>x</code> is bound to <code>1</code> and <code>y</code>, since
there is no second argument, is bound to <code>undefined</code>. But the
body of the function doesn’t actually use <code>y</code>, so the call
returns <code>1</code> since that’s what <code>x</code> was bound
to.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when you call a function with too many
arguments. For example:</p>
<pre><code>function f(x) { return x; }
f(1,2,3);</code></pre>
<p>This calls <code>f</code> with 3 arguments even though it only
expects 1. The parameter <code>x</code> is bound to the first argument,
i.e. <code>1</code>. The remaining arguments are not bound to anything
and therefore are inaccessible in the body of the function.</p>
<p>You are given a slightly modified version of the Iniquity language as
presented in class. Only the interpreter has been modified and it has
been changed to implement the Javascript-style approach to arity
mismatches. Instead of <code>undefined</code> it uses <code>void</code>
as the value to bind to parameters that have no corresponding
argument.</p>
<p>There are three example programs corresponding to the Javascript
programs above:</p>
<p><code>example1.rkt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#lang racket
(define (f x) x)
(f) ; =&gt; void</code></pre>
<p><code>example2.rkt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#lang racket
(define (f x y) x)
(f 1) ; =&gt; 1</code></pre>
<p><code>example3.rkt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#lang racket
(define (f x) x)
(f 1 2 3) ; =&gt; 1</code></pre>
<p>You can see what the interpreter produces by running:</p>
<pre><code>cat example1.rkt | racket -t interp-stdin.rkt -m
cat example2.rkt | racket -t interp-stdin.rkt -m
cat example3.rkt | racket -t interp-stdin.rkt -m</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is <strong><em>different</em></strong> from how Racket
would interpret these programs, which is to signal an error. So if you
run these programs directly in Racket, you’ll get errors.</p>
<p>Your job is to modify <code>compile.rkt</code> so that it is
consistent with the interpreter and also implements the Javascript-style
approach to function calls.</p>
<p>A few tests have been added to the test suite to test this behavior,
but a correct solution should work for more than just the provided
tests.</p>
<p>Note: you do not have to change the behavior of primitive operations,
only user-defined function calls.</p>
