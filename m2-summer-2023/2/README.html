<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>We have aimed to write <strong><em>correct</em></strong> compilers,
where we view the interpreter as specifying what correct means. If the
interpreter produces some value for a given expression, running the code
produced by the compiler for that same expression should produce the
same value. But almost from the beginning, we have had a lurking bug in
our compilers due to the fact that can only accommodate integers of some
fixed size, whereas our interpreters can handle arbitrarily large
integers.</p>
<p>When a specification and implementation are out of sync, we can
resolve the problem by changing the implementation or by changing the
spec (or both). Ideally, we’d like to build a compiler that can handle
arbitrarily large integers, but that’s a little much for an exam
question. Instead, we have provided a modified version of the Fraud
language that has an interpreter that signals an error whenever integers
are produced that exceed the limits of what can be represented in the
compiler’s representation of integers.</p>
<p>Your job is to update the compiler to reflect this new
specification.</p>
<p>A few tests have been added to the <code>tests/</code> directory. You
can run <code>raco test test/interp.rkt</code> to test the interpreter
(all tests should pass) and <code>raco test test/compile.rkt</code> to
test the compiler (some tests will fail).</p>
<p>Update the compiler so that it is correct with respect to the given
interpreter.</p>
