# CMSC430
This is a project consisting of a compiler for a subset of the Racket Language, based on assignments for UMD's CMSC430: Introduction to Compilers (also known as Design and Implementation of Programming Languages). Taken as a whole, the assignments form a compiler for a subset of the Racket programming language. Features include arity checking for function falls, applying a function to a list of arguments, and pattern matching.
